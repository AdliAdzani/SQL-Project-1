# SQL-Project-1
Hi there!

This is my SQL Project 1.

All the dataset, ER diagrams and database used in this SQL project were obtained from Coursera course; SQL for Data Science (from University of California, Dav

Link to see the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science

I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

I used SQLite which was embedded together with the Coursera course and all the analysis was done there.

Feel free to give comments or feedback for my projects.

Thanks!
